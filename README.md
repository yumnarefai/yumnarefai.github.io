## Research Projects 
- **CSC454/491 Capstone Projects**: Product Pitch & Demo  

- **CSC311 Machine Learning Project**: Machine Learning for Educational Data Analysis  
    - **Collaborative Filtering with k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)**: Implemented user-based collaborative filtering using the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, predicting student performance by leveraging similarity in answer patterns with other students.  
    - **Item Response Theory (IRT) Model**: Developed a one-parameter IRT model to estimate the probability of a student answering a question correctly, based on their ability and the question's difficulty.  
    - **Neural Networks**: Designed and trained an autoencoder model to learn user-question interactions, enabling predictions of user responses to unseen questions, facilitating efficient representation learning for personalized recommendations.

- **CSC301 TDS News Journalism AI Agent Project**: Streamlined LLM deployment with AI journalist agents at a news tech corporation, leveraging Django, AWS, Nginx, React, WordPress, and Django.  

- **CSC309 PetPal Adoption App**: Employed Django and Python in the creation of the backend infrastructure for the PetPal adoption application. Used React to develop the frontend UI of PetPal adoption application.
